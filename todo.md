Also i have an interesting method for defining the structures of the schema. What I am currently doing is each structure, equivalent to a SQL table, in the schema, has an associated name and then the actual structure content, and then an ID. The ID is automatically assigned based on the structures location inside the schema file, so the first one is 0, the second is 1, etc. However, this brings me some concerns. mainly, I worry someone is gonna create an object, it gets added to the logs with the integer id to the table, and then they are gonna move the structure up or down in the file, maybe add a new structure in the middle of the file, and then the objects will be pointing to the wrong location. My solution to this problem was save a duplicate copy of the schema on indexing, then next index check for changes, and alter every single id to reflect what it should be with those changes
